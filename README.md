# OpenAlpha_Evolve: Contribute to Improve this Project

![openalpha_evolve_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4709ad-0072-44ae-bbb5-7eea1c5fa08c)

OpenAlpha_Evolve is an open-source Python framework inspired by the groundbreaking research on autonomous coding agents like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It's a **regeneration** of the core idea: an intelligent system that iteratively writes, tests, and improves code using Large Language Models (LLMs) via LiteLLM, guided by the principles of evolution.

Our mission is to provide an accessible, understandable, and extensible platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the fascinating intersection of AI, code generation, and automated problem-solving.

## ‚ú® The Vision: AI-Driven Algorithmic Innovation

Imagine an agent that can:

*   Understand a complex problem description.
*   Generate initial algorithmic solutions.
*   Rigorously test its own code.
*   Learn from failures and successes.
*   Evolve increasingly sophisticated and efficient algorithms over time.

OpenAlpha_Evolve is a step towards this vision. It's not just about generating code; it's about creating a system that *discovers* and *refines* solutions autonomously.

## üß† How It Works: The Evolutionary Cycle

OpenAlpha_Evolve employs a modular, agent-based architecture to orchestrate an evolutionary process:

1.  **Task Definition**: You, the user, define the algorithmic "quest" ‚Äì the problem to be solved, including examples of inputs and expected outputs.
2.  **Prompt Engineering (`PromptDesignerAgent`)**: This agent crafts intelligent prompts for the LLM. It designs:
    *   *Initial Prompts*: To generate the first set of candidate solutions.
    *   *Mutation Prompts*: To introduce variations and improvements to existing solutions, often requesting changes in a "diff" format.
    *   *Bug-Fix Prompts*: To guide the LLM in correcting errors from previous attempts, also typically expecting a "diff".
3.  **Code Generation (`CodeGeneratorAgent`)**: Powered by an LLM (currently configured for Gemini), this agent takes the prompts and generates Python code. If a "diff" is requested and received, it attempts to apply the changes to the parent code.
4.  **Evaluation (`EvaluatorAgent`)**: The generated code is put to the test!
    *   *Syntax Check*: Is the code valid Python?
    *   *Execution*: The code is run in a temporary, isolated environment against the input/output examples defined in the task.
    *   *Fitness Scoring*: Programs are scored based on correctness (how many test cases pass), efficiency (runtime), and other potential metrics.
5.  **Database (`DatabaseAgent`)**: All programs (code, fitness scores, generation, lineage) are stored, creating a record of the evolutionary history (currently in-memory).
6.  **Selection (`SelectionControllerAgent`)**: The "survival of the fittest" principle in action. This agent selects:
    *   *Parents*: Promising programs from the current generation to produce offspring.
    *   *Survivors*: The best programs from both the current population and new offspring to advance to the next generation.
7.  **Iteration**: This cycle repeats for a defined number of generations, with each new generation aiming to produce better solutions than the last.
8.  **Orchestration (`TaskManagerAgent`)**: The maestro of the operation, coordinating all other agents and managing the overall evolutionary loop.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **LLM-Powered Code Generation**: Leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models via LiteLLM, supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).
*   **Evolutionary Algorithm Core**: Implements iterative improvement through selection, LLM-driven mutation/bug-fixing using diffs, and survival.
*   **Modular Agent Architecture**: Easily extend or replace individual components (e.g., use a different LLM, database, or evaluation strategy).
*   **Automated Program Evaluation**: Syntax checking and functional testing against user-provided examples. Code execution is sandboxed using **Docker containers** for improved security and dependency management, with configurable timeout mechanisms.
*   **Configuration Management**: Easily tweak parameters like population size, number of generations, LLM models, API settings, and Docker configurations via `config/settings.py` and `.env`.
*   **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs provide insights into each step of the evolutionary process.
*   **Diff-based Mutations**: The system is designed to use diffs for mutations and bug fixes, allowing for more targeted code modifications by the LLM.
*   **Open Source & Extensible**: Built with Python, designed for experimentation and community contributions.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   `pip` for package management
    *   `git` for cloning
    *   **Docker**: For sandboxed code evaluation. Ensure Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux) is installed and running. Visit [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAlpha_Evolve.git
    cd OpenAlpha_Evolve
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Crucial for API Keys)**:
    *   **This step is essential for the application to function correctly with your API keys.** The `.env` file stores your sensitive credentials and configuration, overriding the default placeholders in `config/settings.py`.
    *   Create your personal environment file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env_example .env
        ```

    #### LLM Configuration
    Google Cloud authentication (e.g., via Application Default Credentials (ADC) or service account keys pointed to by `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) is a supported method for using Google's LLMs.

    To set up your environment variables for Google Cloud, you can use one of the following methods. These should be added to your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # For Google Cloud (Vertex AI / AI Studio)
    # Option 1: Using Application Default Credentials (ADC)
    # Ensure you have authenticated via gcloud CLI:
    # gcloud auth application-default login
    # Or set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable:
    # GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"

    # Option 2: Directly using an API Key for specific Google services (e.g., Gemini API)
    # GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    ```

    This project uses LiteLLM to interface with various LLM providers. For providers other than Google Cloud (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere), please refer to the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for the specific environment variables required. Common examples include:
    ```bash
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
    # COHERE_API_KEY="your_cohere_api_key"
    ```
    Add the necessary API key variables for your chosen LLM provider(s) to your `.env` file.

6.  **Run OpenAlpha_Evolve!**
    Run the example task (Dijkstra's algorithm) with:
    ```bash
    python -m main examples/shortest_path.yaml
    ```
    Watch the logs in your terminal to see the evolutionary process unfold! Log files are also saved to `alpha_evolve.log` (by default).

7.  **Launch the Gradio Web Interface**
    Interact with the system via the web UI. To start the Gradio app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Gradio will display a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) and a public share link if enabled. Open this in your browser to define custom tasks and run the evolution process interactively.

## üí° Defining Your Own Algorithmic Quests!

Want to challenge OpenAlpha_Evolve with a new problem? It's easy! You can define your tasks in two ways:

### 1. Using YAML Files (Recommended)

Create a YAML file in the `examples` directory with the following structure:

```yaml
task_id: "your_task_id"
task_description: |
  Your detailed problem description here.
  Be specific about function names, expected behavior, and constraints.
function_name: "your_function_name"
allowed_imports: ["module1", "module2"]

tests:
  - description: "Test group description" # Describes a group of related tests
    name: "Test group name" # A name for this test group
    test_cases: # This should be a list of individual test cases
      - input: [arg1, arg2]  # First test case
        output: expected_output # Expected result for this input
        # Each test case uses either 'output' for direct comparison
        # or 'validation_func' for more complex validation.
      - input: [arg_for_validation_func_1, arg_for_validation_func_2] # Second test case
        validation_func: |
          def validate(output_from_function):
              # Custom validation logic for this specific test case's output
              # For example, check if output is within a certain range,
              # or if it has specific properties.
              return isinstance(output_from_function, bool) and output_from_function is True
```

See the example in `examples/shortest_path.yaml`

### 2. Using Python Code (Legacy)

You can still define tasks programmatically using the `TaskDefinition` class:

```python
from core.task_definition import TaskDefinition

task = TaskDefinition(
    id="your_task_id",
    description="Your detailed problem description",
    function_name_to_evolve="your_function_name",
    input_output_examples=[
        {"input": [arg1, arg2], "output": expected_output},
        # More examples...
    ],
    allowed_imports=["module1", "module2"]
)
```

### Best Practices for Task Definition

Crafting effective task definitions is key to guiding OpenAlpha_Evolve successfully. Consider these tips:

*   **Be Clear and Unambiguous**: Write task descriptions as if you're explaining the problem to another developer. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly.
*   **Provide Diverse and Comprehensive Examples**: Your test cases are the primary way the agent verifies its generated code.
    *   Include typical use cases
    *   Cover edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, etc.)
    *   Include examples that test different logical paths
    *   Use validation functions for complex checks
*   **Start Simple, Then Increase Complexity**: Break down complex problems into simpler versions first.
*   **Specify Constraints and Edge Cases**: Mention specific constraints and edge cases in the description.
*   **Define Expected Function Signature**: Clearly state the expected function name and parameters.
*   **Iterate and Refine**: Review and refine your task definition based on the agent's performance.
